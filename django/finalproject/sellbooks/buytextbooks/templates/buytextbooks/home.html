            Welcome to Book Hook! We're glad that you chose our platform to sell your books through. Now, a little bit about us: <br>
            The Book Hook team comprises of four friends who met through a coding program. We all wanted to create something that was meaningful to many people. When we observed a lot of students at our schools struggling to sell their used books, we decided to tackle the issue by creating this website. We hope you enjoy the site and the resources it offers, and we look forward to hooking you up with some books! Hereâ€™s a little bit about each of our team members:
